# CS490 Capstone Project: VR Orbit

## Main features
- Mathematically correct orbits
  - Berger's Solution (1978) implemented to calculate Milankovitch paramters
    - Function of time (specific to a calendar date)
    - outputs eccentricity, obliquity, and longitude of perihelion
- Forward and Inverse Keplerian functions to determine Earth's position based on time and vice versa
- Seasonal day-length calculation
